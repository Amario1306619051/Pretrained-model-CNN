# Transfer Learning Workshop: Presidential Doggy Door

Welcome to the "Presidential Doggy Door" workshop! In this workshop, we'll explore the power of transfer learning using a practical example involving image classification. The goal is to create an automated doggy door that can recognize and admit a specific dog named Bo, while keeping out other animals.

## Workshop Overview

### Pre-Trained Models

In this section, we'll explore the concept of pre-trained models and how they can be utilized to solve deep learning challenges without building a model from scratch. We'll use the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

### An Automated Doggy Door

We'll create an automated doggy door that only admits a specific dog named Bo while keeping out other animals. We'll use transfer learning to achieve this, starting with a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on a small dataset of images.

### Training the Model

We'll cover the following steps in training the model:
- Loading and preprocessing the data
- Building the transfer learning model with pre-trained layers
- Compiling the model with appropriate loss and metrics
- Augmenting the data to prevent overfitting
- Training the model and monitoring performance

### Fine-Tuning the Model

After training the initial model, we'll fine-tune it by unfreezing the pre-trained layers and updating them with a very low learning rate. This step helps to further improve the model's accuracy and generalization.

### Bo's Doggy Door

We'll implement the final doggy door functionality, which will use the trained model to determine if the incoming image is Bo or not. Based on the prediction, the system will decide whether to admit the dog or not.

## Conclusion

By the end of this workshop, you'll have gained hands-on experience with transfer learning and built a functional doggy door that recognizes a specific dog. This exercise highlights the power of using pre-trained models and fine-tuning for tasks with limited data. Feel free to explore more possibilities and apply these techniques to your own projects!
